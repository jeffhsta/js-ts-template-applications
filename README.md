# Applications boilerplace

This repo has a few applications boiler which may cover what I use or wish to use.

The stacks covered already are:

- AWS lambda functions with TypeScript
- Express with Typescript

Wish but still missing:

- Elixir with Cowboy, Ecto, ExMachina, Mox (without Phoenix)
- Kotlin with Ktor
- AWS CDK for ECS setup
